# Typy data with Pandas

## Tidying messy datasets

Through the following examples extracted from Wickham's paper, we'll wrangle messy datasets into the tidy format. The goal here is to prepare the data in a standardized way prior to the analysis.

These are the five types of messy datasets we'll tackle:

1. Column headers are values, not variable names.
2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.
3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.
